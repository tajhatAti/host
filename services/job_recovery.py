"""Bots must come back on their own, however often the runner restarts.

THE FAILURE THIS GUARDS AGAINST
-------------------------------
A Render deploy (or a free-tier spin-down) wipes the runner's in-memory job
registry and, on the free tier, its filesystem too. Every bot that was supposed
to be running 24/7 is now gone, while the site's database still says
desired_state='running'. Before this, the ONLY thing that noticed was a single
recovery pass at SITE startup — so when the RUNNER redeployed on its own, nobody
re-created anything: the dashboard showed the bots as stopped, the owners' bots
were dead, and they stayed dead until someone pressed Restart by hand. That is
how a user's bot "just went away".

THREE PARTS
-----------
1. recover_once() — for every desired-running job the fleet no longer has,
   re-create it from the code and env stored in the database, then restore the
   last workspace snapshot (database.db, session.json, data/) so the bot comes
   back with its history, not empty.

2. start_reconciler() — run that same pass forever, every
   JOB_RECOVERY_INTERVAL_S (default 300), instead of once at boot. A runner that
   restarts ten times a day is repaired ten times a day, with nobody involved.

3. auto_deploy_sweep() — on the same thread but its own, longer clock
   (AUTO_DEPLOY_INTERVAL_S, default 600): every 👑 app that follows its branch is
   compared with the branch's current commit and redeployed in place when it has
   moved. "I pushed, why didn't it update?" stops being a question.

WHY IT CANNOT DUPLICATE A RUNNING BOT
-------------------------------------
The dangerous version of this loop is: the runner is asleep or mid-boot, the
fleet probe comes back empty, and the reconciler "recovers" every job — creating
a second copy of each. Two Telegram pollers on one token fight (409 conflict)
and the owner's bot dies anyway. So a job is only re-created when its own worker
ANSWERED the probe and simply does not have it. A worker that did not answer is
skipped this round and retried on the next one; "no information" never means
"the job is gone".

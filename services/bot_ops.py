"""Everything the Telegram bot does to a user's apps, on the SAME rails the
website uses.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
services/pingbot.py called the runner directly. Measured:

    bot deploys a job  ->  rows in jobs table        : 0
                           jobs visible in /admin/jobs: 0
                           runner actually running    : 1

So a bot-deployed app burned real memory while being invisible to the admin
console, exempt from MAX_JOBS_PER_USER, and unable to appear in the owner's own
dashboard. Two deploy paths meant two sets of rules, and only one of them was
enforced.

Everything here goes through the jobs table and runner_client, so an app acted
on from Telegram behaves exactly as it does on the site — same worker routing,
same admin visibility.

CREATION AND CODE EDITING WERE ONCE REMOVED FROM HERE, AND ARE NOW BACK — READ
THIS BEFORE TOUCHING create_app() / update_code().
deploy() and update_code() used to live here while the bot accepted pasted
snippets directly in chat; both were deleted for two reasons: (1) a Telegram
TEXT message caps at ~4096 characters with no editor, so pasted code could
only ever be a toy script, and (2) pingbot.py's code-collection path ran
BEFORE the account-link check existed, so an unlinked stranger's chat could
execute code on the server (reproduced: os.system('whoami') ran unauthenticated).

/code and /update are back for a genuine, requested use case — pushing a fix
from a phone without opening the site — but neither weakness above is allowed
to return:
  · Every command that reaches create_app()/update_code() is gated on
    services.telegram_link.user_for_chat() in pingbot.py's dispatcher, same
    as /restart or /delete. There is no code path here that skips it.
  · Code can arrive as an uploaded FILE (Telegram bot API allows up to 20MB
    on download), not just a 4096-char text message, so a real app's source
    can actually make the trip. Plain-text paste still works too, for quick
    one-line fixes, and still caps out at ~4096 characters — long edits
    should be sent as a file.
  · create_app() and update_code() call the exact same jobs-table insert and
    runner_client calls as POST /api/jobs and PATCH /api/jobs/{id} below —
    same MAX_JOBS_PER_USER cap, same admin visibility. There is still only
    ONE set of rules, just triggered from two UIs now instead of one.
